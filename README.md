-- In RMarkDown there is an error in line 63. When it try to execute the scale function (to standarize the matrix), Markdown fails saying 
"Quitting from lines 63-64 (ML_Markdown.Rmd) 
Error en colMeans(x, na.rm = TRUE) : 'x' must be numeric
Calls: <Anonymous> ... withVisible -> eval -> eval -> scale -> scale.default -> colMeans" ... and the execution stops there.
If I run the same command in the R console, it works fine!!! ... I left a message in the discussion forum.
